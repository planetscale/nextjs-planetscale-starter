# nextjs-planetscale-starter

## Overview

This README will guide you in getting up and running with Next.js starter app with authentication. Immediately, you can allow users to sign up or login to your app, including a built-in admin panel with a users table (data queried from your PlanetScale database). 

We have configured this template for you to one-click deploy directly to Netlify. Alternatively, you can manually deploy to your choice of hosting platform for Next.js applications. For more information on why we created this starter app, read me more in our [blog post]().

## ðŸ¥ž Stack

- Framework - [Next.js v12](https://nextjs.org)
- Language - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Database - [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com)
- ORM - [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- Hosting - [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
- Styling - [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**
A PlanetScale account, [PlanetScale CLI](https://github.com/planetscale/cli#installation), and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

TODO expand on steps, gotta do a few steps to set up the database and its schema to run the starter app

1. Create a PlanetScale database
2. Create a shadow branch
3. Connect to your PlanetScale database main branch locally \
   `pscale connect <database-name> main --port <port>`
4. Connect to your PlanetScale database shadow branch locally  \
   `pscale connect <database-name> shadow --port <port>`
5. Fill in local environment variables for database URLs, NEXTAUTH_URL, and BASE_URL \
   `DATABASE_URL="mysql://root@127.0.0.1:3309/starter"`
   `SHADOW_DATABASE_URL="mysql://root@127.0.0.1:3310/starter`
   `NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000` \
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000` \
   `BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000`
6. Run `yarn install`
7. Run `yarn db:migrate`. After this step, the database schema is ready and you can deploy to Netlify. You can either seed data and run locally, or skip to the one-click deploy to Netlify.
8. Run `yarn db:seed`
9. Run `yarn dev`
10. Go to `https://localhost:3000/admin/setup` to create an admin account to start.

## One-click Deploy with Netlify (recommended)

The one-click deploy allows you to connect Netlify to your GitHub account to clone the `nextjs-planetscale-starter` repository and deploy it automatically. Be sure to go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/signup) and sign up for an account before clicking the deploy button.

[![Deploy to Netlify button](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/planetscale/nextjs-planetscale-starter)

By clicking the above button, you will be navigated to the Netlifyâ€™s direct deploy page with the projectâ€™s repository passed as parameters in the url. Click the **Connect to GitHub** button, name your repository and enter....

TODO what environment variables are needed for Netlify and how to get them
- `DATABASE_URL` (get this one from inside PlanetScale connect modal, Prisma dropdown and copy URL from snippet)
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`

TODO are these needed? 
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`
- `BASE_URL`

> Note: The initial build will fail if the database is not set up following TODO

Once it is live, go to the `/admin/setup` page to create an admin account to get started.
